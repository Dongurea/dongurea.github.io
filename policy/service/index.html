            PARAGRAPHS CAREFULLY AS THEY REQUIRE YOU TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES WITH US THROUGH BINDING INDIVIDUAL
            ARBITRATION. All disputes, claims or controversies arising out of or relating to the Agreement, or the
            relationship between you and us (&ldquo;Dispute&rdquo;) shall be determined exclusively by binding
            arbitration. However, the Dispute does not include any claim regarding the infringement, protection or
            validity of intellectual property rights or a claim brought in small claims court.</span></h3>

            have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration. A party who intends to seek
            arbitration must first send to the other, by certified mail, a written notice of dispute
            (&ldquo;Notice&rdquo;). The Notice to MIM GAMES should be addressed to: &nbsp;MIM GAMES, 405, 1114,
            Gyeongui-ro, Paju-si, Gyeonggi-do, Republic of Korea, ATTENTION: Legal Department. &nbsp;The Notice must (a)
            describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute; and (b) specify the remedies sought by the claimant.
            If you and we do not reach an agreement to resolve the claim within 30 days after the Notice is received,
            you or we may commence an arbitration proceeding. </span></h3>

            arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other. The Federal Arbitration Act shall apply to
            the interpretation and enforcement of this Section 24 notwithstanding any other choice of law provision
            contained in this Agreement. The arbitration shall be administered by the American Arbitration Association
            (&ldquo;AAA&rdquo;) under its Consumer Arbitration Rules (&ldquo;AAA Rules&rdquo;) then in effect. The AAA
            Rules are available at www.adr.org/consumer. Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation
            shall be governed by the AAA Rules and, where appropriate, limited by the AAA Rules. The arbitration may be
            conducted in person, through the submission of documents, by phone or online. Arbitration of any claim not
            exceeding $25,000 will be conducted solely on the basis of documents you and we submit to the arbitrator.
            The arbitrator shall make a decision in writing, and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by
            either party. Either party may litigate in court to compel arbitration, to stay proceedings pending
            arbitration, or to confirm, modify, vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator.</span>

            PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION TRIED OR CHALLENGED BY A JURY. The

            of representative or class action. The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor
